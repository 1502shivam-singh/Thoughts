# Some project ideas that came to me at odd-times, collected together


- **Diffchecker** : An app (web-based most probably) that compares 2 files simultaneously and provides a diff of both the files in an easily understandable way.

- **File comparison** : A command-line tool that can be used to compare files in 2 (initial target) provided directories and provide general differences between the directories like files that are the same, number of different files etc.

- **Production ready video manipulation tool**, completely online with ability to allow multiple people to collaborate at once. For advanced usage, will have AI powered tools integrated within it.

- Similar to above one, but for images. **Something like Photoshop ported to the web**, working at the same efficiency as an application software.

- **An audio processing tool, similar to ableton, but ported to the web**. All the above ports have collaboration inbuilt.
